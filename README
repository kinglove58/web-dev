# Random Food Selector

This project is a simple JavaScript application that selects a random food item from a predefined list.

## How It Works

The application uses a JavaScript function named `Randomvalue` to generate a random index for the `foods` array. The `Randomvalue` function takes two parameters: `max` and `min`, which define the range of possible indices.

The `Randomvalue` function works as follows:

1. Calculate the range of possible values (`returnValue`) by subtracting `min` from `max` and adding 1.
2. Generate a random number (`randomNum`) between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
3. Scale the random number to the desired range to get `randomVal`.
4. Round `randomVal` down to the nearest whole number to get `roundedNum`, which is the final result.

The application then logs the food item at the randomly generated index to the console.

## Usage

To use this application, simply open the HTML file in your browser. The randomly selected food item will be logged to the console.
